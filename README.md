> **The Ultimate Stealth Productivity Shield.** A minimalist task manager that doubles as a ruthless domain-locking tool for deep work.

## ❓ The Value Proposition
Why run two extensions when one can do it better? **TaskCore** is designed to replace both your standalone task manager and your site blocker. By unifying these tools into a single, high-performance package, we reduce browser overhead and maintain a professional "False Front" that keeps your productivity habits private.

## ⚠️ Important Disclaimer & Liability
**TaskCore is a productivity aid, not a foolproof security system.**

* **User Responsibility:** The developers of TaskCore are **NOT** responsible if a user chooses to bypass the block.
* **Non-Absolute Protection:** This extension uses client-side scripting. A knowledgeable user can bypass this block (e.g., by disabling the extension or using browser developer tools). It is designed as a "friction barrier" to discourage distractions.
* **Session Persistence:** Access is granted on a per-session basis. If you have unlocked a site, the block will not re-trigger until the tab is closed.
* **Critical Usage Note:** To ensure your focus is protected, **you must close the tab** once your session is complete to re-engage the guard.

## 🕵️ Stealth Architecture
This extension utilizes "Security through Obscurity". It is intentionally branded as a generic system task manager to remain inconspicuous in your extension list and to any casual observers.

### 🚀 Key Features
* **Functional False Front:** A native dark-mode interface for managing daily tasks (Full CRUD capabilities).
* **Terminal Lock UI:** An unbranded, high-performance system shell for authentication.
* **Granular Security Panel:** View all locked domains and remove them individually.
* **PIN-Gated Unblocking:** Master PIN is required to remove a domain from the lock list.
* **Auto-Unlock Logic:** Instant SHA-256 hashing for seamless access—validates as you type.
